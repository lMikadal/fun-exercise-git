## Challenges

## Challenge 1: Three-Way Merge Practice by using git commit and git merge

### Guide:

- Create a new branch from the `main` branch e.g. `maithai-feature`
- Checkout to the new branch
- Edit the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file by adding your name to the `Contributors` section
- `git status` to see status of the changes
- `git diff` to see the changes
- Add the changes to the staging area
- `git diff --staged` to see the changes in the staging area
- Commit the changes
- Checkout to the `main` branch
- Merge the new branch to the `main` branch
- Push the changes to the remote repository at main branch verify by using `git log --graph --oneline`. You should see the commit history like below:

```bash
* commit C (main): Merge branch 'maithai-feature'
|\
| * commit B (maithai-feature): Implement feature Maithai
|/
* commit A: Initial project setup
```

</summary>

- Create a new branch from the `main` branch e.g. `maithai-feature`

```bash
git branch maithai-feature
```

- Checkout to the new branch

```bash
git checkout maithai-feature
```

- Edit the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file by adding your name to the `Contributors` section
- Commit the changes

```bash
git add CONTRIBUTORS.md
git commit -m "Add my name to the Contributors section"
```

- Checkout to the `main` branch

```bash
git checkout main
```

- Merge the new branch to the `main` branch

```bash
git merge maithai-feature --no-ff
```

- Push the changes to the remote repository at main branch

```bash
git push origin main
```

</details>

## Challenge 2: Three-Way Merge Practice by using Pull Request

### Guide:

- Create a new branch from the `main` branch e.g. `monkan-feature`
- Checkout to the new branch
- Edit the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file by adding your name to the `Contributors` section
- `git status` to see status of the changes
- `git diff` to see the changes
- Add the changes to the staging area
- `git diff --staged` to see the changes in the staging area
- Commit the changes
- Push the changes to the remote repository at the new branch
- Create a Pull Request from the new branch to your `main` branch (‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Create PR for your repository</b>)
- Merge the Pull Request
- Pull the changes from the remote repository at the `main` branch
- Verify by using `git log --graph --oneline`. You should see the commit history like below:

```bash
* commit E (HEAD -> main, origin/main): Merge pull request #1 from <your-github-username>/monkan-feature
|\
| * commit C (monkan-feature): Implement feature Monkan
|/
* commit C (main): Merge branch 'maithai-feature'
|\
| * commit B (maithai-feature): Implement feature Maithai
|/
* commit A: Initial project setup
```
